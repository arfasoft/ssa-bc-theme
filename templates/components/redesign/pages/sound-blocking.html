      Want to Block Airborne Noise?
      <span>You Need A Noise Barrier!</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The manufacture of sound blocking materials is big business these days, and it’s not because of
      the automotive industry. Creating more comfortable and environmental living spaces has been a growing
      priority for the construction industry, and automotive companies are starting to
      wise up and apply those lessons to auto. For commercial and residential construction, the leading
      noise blocking materials are gypsum board (drywall) and mass loaded vinyl (MLV). Both gypsum and
      MLV have a comparable density per square foot, but mass loaded vinyl is the leading solution for
      vehicles because of its flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember earlier when I talked about sound deadening and sound blocking working together to reduce
      the noise level by 15 decibels? You don't? Well, that's why I said it again! Those unwanted sounds
      you hear inside your vehicle are traveling towards you along two very different paths. To get the
      best results, you have to match the product to the path you want to silence.

        <h4>Structural Noise</h4>
        <p>
          Some sound waves travel through the vehicle’s structure before radiating into the passenger compartment.
          Vibration energy generated by mechanical systems and from road and tire friction moves through the metal
          chassis, floorboard panels and body structure of the vehicle before reradiating into the car cabin as
          noise. In many cases, the metal panels can even amplify the sound, like the buzzing noise when you turn
          the bass up on your audio system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution to improve your acoustics is to apply
          <a href="/sound-deadening/car-door-insulation-for-best-car-audio/">car audio sound deadening</a>
          material to any metal that vibrates. As the name implies, sound deadening materials dampen the
          metal and mute the vibrations, much like stopping a noisy wind chime with your hand.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="noise-barrier__col">
        <h4>Airborne Noise</h4>
        <p>
          Other types of unwanted noise travel into the vehicle by air. The air molecules
          surrounding the vehicle transmit unwanted sound from the exterior of the car, through the body panel,
          and then finally into the passenger compartment. These noises include the droning noise of exhaust
          system resonance, the roaring of road noise that comes from the tires, and even noise from air flowing
          under the vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution to airborne noise is to create a high quality sound barrier using the three key principles
          of blocking sound: heavy, limp, and airtight. The idea is to create a personal bubble that rejects airborne
          sound waves before they reach you.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you use the wrong products for the application, use low-quality products, or apply products
      incorrectly, you will get inferior results. That’s why people get widely differing results
      when adding <a href="/sound-deadening/">sound dampening material</a>
      to their vehicles. Avoiding those expensive mistakes is easy &ndash; thank goodness you're reading
      up on it!

    <h3>
      What Makes an Effective Noise Barrier?
    </h3>
    <p>
      To see how this works, let’s look at how a <a href="/soundproofing/">soundproof room</a> is constructed. The same
      principles apply to soundproofing a room as soundproofing a vehicle. So, picture a recording
      studio &ndash; go ahead and put your favorite musician in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musician's in there? Just checking. If you are like most people, you are picturing a room with
      <a href="/sound-blocking/soundproofing-walls/">soundproof walls</a> that are
      covered with a thick foam padding. That soft foam is serviceable as <a href="/acoustics/">acoustics material</a>
      in a room, but it is not a noise barrier. In fact, if there was a wall made only of that soft
      foam separating you from another person, you would be able to converse through it because sound
      easily penetrates open cell foam. Then why is the foam there? Because instead of blocking noise,
      the soft, lightweight foam is excellent at absorbing sound and quelling light echoes. That’s all it does.
      If that's what you're looking for, cool. We've got <a href="/melamine-foam/">melamine foam sheets</a> for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what prevents outside noise, like the sounds of street traffic or of the rock group next door,
      from entering the recording studio? It’s the construction of the wall: more specifically the effective
      combination of drywall, insulation, and mass loaded vinyl. A material’s sound isolation properties increase
      linearly with its mass. A denser material blocks sound better than a less dense material, per Egan’s Mass
      Law Curve in <i>Architectural Acoustics</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="image-box"><img src="{{cdn 'webdav:graph-small.gif'}}" alt="chart of Egan's Mass Law Curve" /></p>
    <p>
      Gypsum board can be anywhere from 1 to 3 lbs per sq ft depending on its thickness and the manufacturer.
      Typically, a 1/4” board of drywall is about 1.2 lbs per square foot and 5/8” of drywall is about 2.6 lbs
      per square foot with ½” drywall falling in the middle. Mass loaded vinyl is typically sold between 1 lb per
      square foot and 2 lbs per sq ft. Because the amount of sound blocked is linear relative to mass,
      thicker and denser material always means reduced noise.
      <p>
        To achieve the sound isolation required of a recording studio, you need a wall assembly consisting of
        multiple layers of gypsum board and mass loaded vinyl with batt insulation inside the stud cavities.
        You may even utilize a double stud system to further bulk up your wall. No matter the wall construction,
        your room won’t be soundproofed unless you also address the biggest weaknesses: the doors and windows.
        A typical door without seals has nearly a square foot of airspace around it, so a
        <a href="/sound-blocking/soundproof-door/">soundproof door</a> becomes a critical component.

    <h3>Applying Home Soundproofing Techniques to Automotive</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="content__inner-wrapper">
    <div class="content__col">
      <p>
        Let’s take these home soundproofing principles and apply them over to automotive. A good place to start
        is with the three key principles that create a successful noise barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="h4">Dense:</span>
        you need at least one pound per square foot to effectively repel sound waves (and the heavier the better).
        If you go much lower than that, the STC rating won’t be high enough to be worth the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="h4">Limp:</span>
        the barrier should be somewhat malleable and soft to absorb the energy of noise vibration
        and to prevent it from resonating
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="h4">Unbroken:</span>
        any gaps in the barrier are gaps that sound waves can travel through
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

    </div>
    <div class="content__col">

      <p>
        Mass loaded vinyl is the preferred automotive solution instead of gypsum board. The term "MLV" comes
        from the way the vinyl material is manufactured. To increase the mass of the vinyl sheets, heavy metal particles
        are mixed in during the manufacturing process. That extra weight increases the density and creates an effective
        sound blocker. MLV is preferrable to gypsum board in cars for two reasons. First, it’s more “limp”, one of our
        3 key qualifications. Second, it’s flexible. The curved, vibrating surfaces of a vehicle would be a terrible
        place
        to try and install drywall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second Skin’s mass loaded vinyl options range from 1 lb per sq ft to 1.25 lbs per sq ft. We don’t recommend
        going
        up to 2 lbs per sq ft because the material becomes less workable, making it challenging to fit around the
        contours of your car.

        <h4>Limp barriers work better than rigid ones</h4>
        <div class="accordion-new__item-content">
          <p>
            The mass loaded vinyl barrier has to be somewhat limp, because the give prevents your barrier from
            vibrating.
            This is true whether you're installing the MLV inside the wall of a room in your house
            or under the carpet in your vehicle. Think about if you hit a sheet of lead (which used to to be the go-to
            blocking
            blocking material before we learned about the health concerns)&semi; it won’t reverberate
            and ring like a rigid sheet of tin or brass. It’s the same with mass loaded vinyl
            &ndash; the flexibility and limpness prevent the MLV from vibrating. Because the MLV material
            doesn’t vibrate, you don’t hear the ringing sound.

        </div>

        <h4>What should you look for in an MLV sound barrier?</h4>
        <div class="accordion-new__item-content">
          <p>
            The first thing you should confirm is the quality of the mass loaded vinyl. Two key indicators of quality
            are the MLV's
            <a href="/sound-blocking/stc-rating/">STC rating</a> and whether or not the company will describe it as
            odorless.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The STC rating tells you how well the MLV blocks sound waves, the higher the better. The density of most
              MLVs is between 1 pound per sq ft to 2 pounds per sq ft. The industry standard is 1 lb, which is what we
              recommend for vehicles because the denser versions of MLV are not as workable around a vehicle's curves.
              Most people use the 1 lb density for homes as well. For this density, you're looking for an STC in the the
              26 to 28 range.
            </li>
            <li>
              Being odorless indicates the quality of the materials that compose the MLV. It's possible to cut costs by
              making the MLV out of cheap recycled goods, but you pay for that cheapness in odor and blocking power.

          <p>Most MLV products are made from recycled goods. We are a fan of recycling, but it's important to make sure
            you're getting the best quality if its going into your living spaces. If you get the cheap-o MLV, some of
            the problems you can run into are&colon; </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Inconsistent thickness, which can reduce the mass per square foot and reduce the effectiveness of your MLV

        We always recommend Luxury Liner Pro for any vehicle as part of a sound reduction project. It’s an excellent
        soundproofing material that combines an MLV sound barrier with a bonded layer of
        <a href="/closed-cell-foam/">closed cell foam</a>. When I say
        bonded, I mean bonded. The foam won’t peel off like you often see with lower quality options. The MLV blocks
        airborne noise that’s coming up from below the vehicle, and the foam provides buffer space for the sound energy
        to bleed harmlessly off. Without the decoupling layer of closed cell foam, the sound deadener or metal and
        your MLV can resonate together, severely reducing the sound isolation effect of your noise barrier. Because
        the decoupler is already included, Luxury Liner Pro will give you best-in-class results while saving you time
        and effort on your install.
      </p>
      <p>
        Made in the USA, Luxury Liner Pro is our best automotive noise and <a href="/heat-insulation/">thermal

        How to Install Luxury
        <span>Liner Pro</span>
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content__col">
      <p>
        You don’t have to use an adhesive if you’re using it on the floor, but we recommend one.
        Apply Luxury Liner Pro using the Second Skin Contact Spray Adhesive, another strong adhesive
        (like 3M 90), or a super strong double sided tape. Apply the adhesive to the top of your
        sound deadener and to the foam side of the Luxury Liner Pro. We do not recommend installing
        Luxury Liner Pro on the car roof or anywhere else it’ll be upside down &ndash; it’s heavy and
        may fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the 3 rules we discussed earlier! When installing the mass loaded vinyl, it should be
        left somewhat limp to prevent the MLV from resonating as it blocks sound waves. It also should
        installed covering as close to 100% of the car’s floor as possible with the seams taped together
        to ensure you don’t have any gaps. By using high quality, dense MLV, and installing it as a limp,
        unbroken layer, you’ll create the most effective noise barrier possible for your vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        We always recommend installing Luxury Liner Pro at the same time that you’re
        installing your Damplifier Pro sound deadener - save yourself the time and effort and do it all in one project.

    <h3>
      Luxury Liner &ndash; an MLV Noise Barrier for Home Use and for Vehicles
    </h3>
    <p>
      Luxury Liner is our MLV without the fused layer of closed cell foam. Just like with Luxury Liner Pro,
      we’re very particular about the quality of the vinyl to ensure it’s odorless and the mass per square
      foot is consistent. Luxury Liner is most commonly used for sound isolation in two use cases involving
      home or commercial soundproofing projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first use case is replacing a layer of drywall to beef up a wall’s STC rating. To create a
      soundproof wall, it’s very common to screw two layers of gypsum board together to increase density
      and sound isolation. Mass loaded vinyl can be used in place of one of these layers of drywall to
      get a higher STC rating at a lower total wall thickness. MLV is a denser material than gypsum board,
      so it blocks more sound per inch than gypsum board alone. Just staple the MLV airtight to the studs
      with holes cut into it for wall outlets and other openings. Then caulk all edges with a non-hardening
      compound. By using acoustical caulk that stays rubbery, when the caulk dries it won’t get brittle
      and chip away. You likely will also want to use foil tape to ensure the barrier is airtight. After
      installing the MLV, screw the gypsum board flat against it to complete your airtight barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second use case is for a partial wall that doesn’t go up above a dropped ceiling. If the wall
      stops at the ceiling tiles, noise can easily pass through the tiles and into neighboring rooms or
      offices. Blocking this noise path is key for <a href="/soundproofing/office-soundproofing/">office soundproofing</a>.
      Install the mass loaded vinyl from the top of the wall to the true ceiling, extending the
      wall and blocking any noise that was passing over your partial wall. While we don't recommend mass loaded vinyl on an actual ceiling,
      it is an effective <a href="/soundproofing/soundproof-ceiling/">ceiling soundproofing</a> option to seal up a partial wall 
      with a dropped ceiling that's acting as a flanking path. Either MLV or our <a href="/acoustics/blocknzorbe">BlocknZorbe sound panels</a>
       are great for plugging the hole. As always, you’ll want to use acoustical caulk and seal seams to ensure an airtight barrier. If plugging
       the hole isn't feasible, your next best option is our of our ceiling tile backers to increase the amount of noise blocked by the dropped ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>For Automotive&colon; Don’t Skip The Decoupler</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember we said that everybody who installs sound control products does not get the same
      results? We always recommend using a decoupler when installing Luxury Liner MLV in vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use Luxury Liner on top of Damplifier, or any other sound deadener, you need to install
      a soft, decoupling layer (such as our OverKill Pro closed cell foam or Heat Wave Pro
      <a href="/jute-insulation/">jute insulation</a>). The softer decoupling material prevents the
      two hard surfaces from resonating together. Don't allow the sound waves from that vibration energy
      to reduce your results.

        Using MLV Around the House
      </h3>
      <p>
        Luxury Liner is an excellent solution for your typical wall soundproofing project (there are better options for ceiling
        or <a href="/soundproofing/soundproof-floor/">floor soundproofing</a> projects. The MLV should be installed on the wall
        directly attached to the studs, so that it has flexibility to hang limp and block sound. That's what makes MLV such an effective
        noise barrier. It's not just the density, it's that the material's limpness flexes when hit with the sound waves' energy like
        a bed sheet sucking the energy out of a tennis ball you threw at it. On top of the MLV, install 5/8" thick gypsum board and
        then seal up the entire perimeter and around any penetrations with <a href="/soundproofing/acoustical-sealant">acoustic caulk</a>.
        You can choose to leave the MLV exposed, but you lose the density benefit of an extra layer sheetrock and some people aren't
        a fan of the look. :) Either way, don't skip the gap sealing step or you'll have wasted your time soundproofing the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luxury Liner MLV can be used in home theater rooms, music rooms, or even to help quiet down your
        backyard. MLV turns any old wooden fence into a <a href="/sound-blocking/soundproof-fence/">sound barrier
          fence</a>.
        Did you buy your kid a drum set for Christmas? Maybe it's time you looked into some better room soundproofing
        and some
        <a href="/acoustics/acoustic-panels/">acoustical panels</a>.
        Want to create a soundproof booth? You’re looking for an MLV noise barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mass loaded vinyl can be used to wrap anything making noise, like metal HVAC ducts, a
        <a href="/sound-deadening/soundproof-generator-box/">generator box</a>, or plumbing pipes.

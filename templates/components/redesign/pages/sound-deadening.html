        <h3>Why Do Cars Make So Much Noise?</h3>
        <p>Noise inside the passenger compartment of a car comes from one of three sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Noise that enters through gaps, holes, and open windows.
            </li>
            <li>
                Noise that is generated by automotive mechanical systems and travels through the
                vehicle structure before radiating into the passenger compartment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Noise that is generated by automotive systems or an external source and enters the
                passenger compartment by first traveling through air, then passing through a body
                panel, and finally reradiating into the passenger compartment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The first type of noise &ndash; sounds that enter through holes, gaps, and windows
            &ndash; is what most people think of as wind noise.
            Noise reduction for wind noise is fairly simple&hellip; fill the holes. Solving for the other two types of
            car noise is more complicated, but we'll teach you

            The science behind car sound deadening is the same as other parts of the vehicle. A sound damping material
            acts to the metal body panels the same way a shock absorber does to automotive suspension. As the wheel goes
            up and down over bumps, the shock absorber resists movement in both directions by pushing a piston through
            oil. This resistance reduces the amplitude of the travel of the chassis by a small amount each time,
            eventually coming to rest. A sound dampening material does the same thing, just in a different way. By
            resisting the minute stretches required for the metal to move in and out like a drum head, the amplitude is
            reduced, reducing the sound radiated into the car cabin.

            <h3>Our Most Popular Product: Damplifier Pro</h3>
            <p>
                Two things matter for quality sound deadening (1) the quality of rubber and (2) the
                thickness of the materials. Our most popular product is the Damplifier Pro&trade;
                sound deadening mat &ndash; and it excels at both.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The self-adhesive mats are simple to install. Just cut, peel and stick. Controlling sheet metal
                    vibrations is the first step to improving automotive sound quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We only use high-quality butyl rubber and thick annealed foil. We do not use
                    cheap asphalt or fillers, and we don't skimp on the foil's thickness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Butyl rubber is safe for use inside your vehicle. It's tough, won't melt, and
                    won't out gas chemicals when it's hot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Damplifier Pro was engineered for high performance, scoring between very good
                    and outrageously good on industry standard vibration testing. It also has
                    good <a href="/heat-insulation/">thermal insulation</a> properties
                    to help keep your vehicle comfortable.

        <h3>The Two Types of Unwanted Noise: <span>Structural &amp; Airborne</span></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content__inner-wrapper">
        <div class="content__col">
            <h4>Structural Noise</h4>
            <p>
                Structural noises originate from the exhaust, tires, and other external noise sources before entering
                the vehicle and transmitting through body panels and other metal components. You hear these car noises
                as vibrations, buzzing noises, roaring, droning, humming, rattles, squeaks, and groans. It's
                particularly bad in older and antique cars, and of course, any vehicle that has a killer audio system.
            </p>
            <p>
                It gets worse. The metal body panels will actually amplify your car's structural noises. That's why you
                hear those aggravating buzzing noises with the audio system's deep bass sound. That's also one of the
                reasons your car is much louder on the highway &ndash; which is often when people notice the worst road
                noise. Highway road noise can be so loud that you can't hear the person in the passenger seat.
                Soundproofing
                your car will solve these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best way to reduce structural noise is by applying damping materials to the vehicle's body panels. A
                damping material is a resilient material that constrains the motion of the panel. "Loudness" correlates
                to the sound waves' amplitude, so by reducing the amplitude, we reduce the noise level. The less a car's
                body panel can flex, the softer the sound will be that it radiates.

            <h4>Airborne Noise</h4>
            <p>
                Airborne noises are sound waves that travel into the car through the air and then
                bounce back and forth inside the car's cabin. The best ways to soundproof airborne
                noise is to block or absorb it. You either want the sound waves to never reach you
                or, once they're in the car, to stop them from reverberating. Then you get to enjoy
                the quiet, calm environment you've created.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of a recording studio. The studio's walls and ceiling are lined with materials
                that block, trap, and absorb unwanted airborne noise, so only the music is heard and
                recorded. Soundproofing a car uses the same principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                In most cases, some sound will still be transmitting through the body even if you did an excellent job
                damping the metal and dampening that structural noise. Blocking the airborne noise that does make it
                through is the next step. Reducing sound transmission requires mass. When working in a building, that
                mass is typically added using gypsum board (drywall) or concrete. For an automotive sound barrier, <a
                    href="/sound-blocking/">mass loaded vinyl</a> is the best option to achieve high mass with good
                flexibility and a limited thickness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once airborne sound waves are inside the car cabin, the last line of defense is to absorb them. The OEM
                insulation
                and upholstery in your car do most of the work here. If you're looking to add on, two high quality
                options are
                <a href="/melamine-foam/">hydrophobic melamine foam</a> and <a href="/jute-insulation/">jute
                    insulation</a>.

        <h3>
            Quality Materials Matter for Sound Deadening.
            <span>Don't Be Fooled.</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The best products combine a butyl rubber, elastomeric compound with a thick,
            high-quality foil. They also don't use &quot;filler&quot; material, that's cheap but
            hurts performance. <b>Think about it this way. Using filler is like stuffing your meatballs
                full of rice to make them bigger.</b> Sure, you've got bigger meatballs. But they don't taste as good,
            because there's a lot of rice in there and it's not as FLAVORFUL. More filler makes the mat less
            rubbery and less elastomeric, so it won't snap back into shape like it's supposed to.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we manufacture our <strong>Damplifier&trade; and Damplifier Pro&trade;</strong>
            self-adhesive sheets, we cut out all the fillers. Who wants a product that <b>looks</b> thick
            if it <b>performs</b> worse? Not us. We also don't use cheap, flimsy foil. Yes... that would save us money,
            but it won't constrain the butyl adhesive as well to stop those vibrations. Again, you've got an inferior
            product.
            That attention to detail is why our product specs are so much better than competing products.
        </p>
        <p>
            The worst quality sound deadening material you can buy is made from asphalt roofing
            material. (No... just no.) Yes, asphalt will deaden metal a little bit so you'll see SOME impact.
            Somewhere between <b>10% and 30% the effectiveness of Damplifier Pro&trade;.</b> And maybe that sounds ok to
            you, because
            you're willing to sacrifice performance to save some money. The reason we avoid asphalt entirely in
            automotive is because
            we don't mess around with the health concerns. We are especially concerned about using
            <a href="/sound-deadening/cheap-sound-deadener/">cheap sound deadening</a> materials around heat producing
            components or
            in a warmer climate, because asphalt will melt and out gas chemicals at high temperatures.
            Avoid the sticky mess and the fumes. Keep asphalt on your roof or on the road, not inside
            your car.
        </p>
        <p>
            How do I know if a sound deadener has asphalt? None of them mention asphalt anywhere!
            (Wonder why that is&hellip;) That's the hardest thing about automotive sound deadening for your average DIY
            researcher.
            It can be hard to tell what's INSIDE the various mats. If you've read down to here in an article about
            automotive sound deadening, you care about improving the sound quality of your ride. Fortunately, there are
            some easy tells you can look for:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Anything sold by the roll is likely to be repurposed roofing material</b> like what you can get
                    at the local hardware store. It
                    probably contains asphalt, and it definitely doesn't have a solid foil constraint layer. You can't
                    roll up good foil like that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Look for the temperature rating.</b> Asphalt melts at a lower temperature than rubber, so as you
                    start seeing a lower
                    temperature range &ndash; the sound deadening material has cheaper fillers in it at best, but
                    probably contains asphalt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Buy made in the USA.</b> While we've found USA-made products with a high filler content, we have
                    yet to see one with an asphalt base.
                    The imported sound deadening mats tend to be much cheaper per sqft, and much more likely to use
                    asphalt.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            So there you go &ndash; one of the sound deadening industry's dirty little secrets. Use
            the information how you will.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back to Second Skin &ndash; if you're looking for an alternate sound deadening product
            to our mats, try a
            <a href="/sound-deadening/soundproofing-liquid-sprays-and-paints/">sound deadening
                spray</a> like <strong>Spectrum&trade; or the thicker Spectrum Sludge&trade;.</strong>
            Both are water-based viscoelastic materials specifically formulated by Second Skin for
            high performance and easy workability. Yes, they work well. They're also easy to clean
            up with soap and water, environmentally friendly, and non-toxic. You just apply them
            differently. Spectrum&trade; is easy to spray, brush, or roll on. You
            can use it in place of our Damplifier products or in addition to them,
            because they can go places where it's hard to apply a
           sound deadening mat, like your vehicle's undercarriage or for

                These can be used together. Many people do just that. The sound deadening mats are
                great for flat areas, making it an excellent choice for the firewall, floor, roof,
                or trunk. Mats can follow curves well too, if you trim them to fit, which is what
                most customers do for their door panels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sound deadening liquids are great for those hard to reach places, like a
                <a href="/sound-deadening/car-undercoating-soundproofing/">sound deadening undercoat</a>,
                inside the fenders, and inside the wheel wells. We think both products look
                great &ndash; Damplifier has black mats with a ghosted Second Skin logo whereas
                Spectrum has a dark grey, seamless look once it dries.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can apply Spectrum inside the car too. The product is really easy to spray or
                brush on once you've exposed the metal. It typically just comes down to your
                preference. Spraying Spectrum&trade; really shines if you have a large area to
                treat, like the inside of a van, the back of a Jeep, or a truck bed. Be sure to use
                our PlastiWrap&trade; and Wire Tape&trade; to mask off anything you don't want to be
                sprayed. Don't want to spray or don't have the equipment? No problem.
                Spectrum&trade; and Spectrum Sludge&trade; are easy to apply with a brush or roller.
                The Sludge can even by applied by hand.

               Damplifier Pro and Spectrum have been used around the home to soundproof dishwasher
                enclosures, tame unruly washing machines, or to quiet HVAC ducting. Commercially our vibration dampers have
                been used in too many ways to count, ranging from coin counting machines to
                hospital and warehouse carts. If the metal rattles, a little of our high quality
                sound insulation material will deaden it.

    <p>Heat shields are designed to protect structures from extreme temperatures by reflecting heat or preventing its transfer. A good
      heat shield needs to have high thermal resistance and thermal emittance, so it can withstand high temperatures and
      reflect and release the heat away from itself. Heat shields are commonly used in the automotive and aerospace
      industries.</p>

    <p>Second Skin offers several types of engine and exhaust heat shields. Mega Block is temperature rated to 1000&deg;F and is backed
      with insulating melamine foam for best-in-class <a href="/heat-insulation/">automotive heat insulation</a>. Thermal Block
      is temperature rated to
      800&deg;F and backed with a thin layer of <a href="/melamine-foam/">hydrophobic melamine foam</a> for spot heat fixes.
      Both heat shields are lightweight, 98% reflective, and include a peel and
      stick backing for easy application. If you are concerned about heat in your car, a heat shield can be a great
      solution to increase the longevity of your vehicle and your comfort level while driving it.</p>

          <p class="">A car heat shield is an important tool to protect key components and bodywork from heat damage. The heat given
      off by your engine and exhaust can reduce engine performance, increase the
      temperature in your car cabin, damage mechanical parts, and even reduce the expected life of your paint
      job. Applying heat shield material as <a href="/heat-insulation/hood-insulation/">hood insulation</a>
      or <a href="/heat-insulation/car-firewall-insulation/">firewall insulation</a> will significantly mitigate these issues
      and help extend the life of your car or truck.</p>

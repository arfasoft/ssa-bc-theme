        <p>Heat shields are designed to protect structures from extreme temperatures by reflecting or absorbing heat. A good heat
        shield needs to have high thermal resistance and thermal emittance, so it can withstand high temperatures and reflect and
        release the heat away from itself. Heat shields are commonly used in the automotive and aerospace industries.

            A car heat shield can be an important tool to protect key components and bodywork from heat damage. The heat given off
            by your engine and traveling through the exhaust tunnel can reduce your engineâ€™s performance, increase the temperature
            in your car cabin, damage mechanical parts behind the dash, and reduce the expected life of your paint job. Applying an
            engine heat shield or exhaust heat shield can help solve these problems.

            insulating melamine foam for best-in-class <a href="/heat-insulation/">automotive heat insulation</a>. Thermal Block 
            is temperature rated to 800 F and backed with organic fibers. Both heat shields
            are lightweight, 98% reflective, and include a peel and stick backing for easy application. If you are concerned about 
            heat in your car, a heat shield can be a great solution to increase the longevity of your vehicle and your comfort level
            while driving it.

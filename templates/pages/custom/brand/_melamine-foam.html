            Melamine foam is a highly absorptive open cell foam used in cars to improve acoustics and add 
            thermal insulation. Best known as the super-absorptive magic eraser, high quality versions of
            melamine foam are aerospace grade materials. Instead of hand-held sponges, these enhanced versions 
            can be bought as melamine foam sheets and have exceptional physical properties.

                can be bought as melamine foam sheets and have exceptional physical properties. Because the sheets are hydrophobic, they are

                Second Skin’s Mega Zorbe hydrophobic melamine foam sheets come with a peel and stick adhesive
                or with no adhesive included. These sheets will add insulation to a car’s roof above the headliner
                or improve speaker acoustics and reduce echoes when installed in door cavities.

            Vibrating metal is loud. Most people would rather live in a quiet, calm environment. The combination of
            these two facts has birthed an entire industry of sound deadening materials for automotive applications. 
            Sound deadening for cars usually is describing a process called <a href="/sound-deadening/">vibration damping</a>,
            which is a material is adhered to the metal surface to reduce vibrational noise (or structural noise).
            There are two primary categories of vibration dampers used in vehicles: sound deadening mats and
            sound deadening liquids.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every sound deadening mat has a constraint layer (often aluminum foil) and an elastomeric material that
            also acts as an adhesive. There’s a lot of math and science behind it, but basically the quality of the 
            materials, the thickness of the materials, and the quality of the bond formed with the application surface
            determines the effectiveness of the sound deadener. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Second Skin has developed it’s own formula that we use in our Damplifier Pro and Damplifier sound deadening
            mats. We have not yet found a mat that performs better than Damplifier Pro (we use labs to test). The #1 thing 
            to remember about sound deadening mats is that you’re looking for butyl rubber, not asphalt. People buy asphalt
            because it’s cheaper and they often don’t know better. Unfortunately, you end up spending more because asphalt
            performs so much worse (butyl damps 3-10x better depending on temperature and the brand), has been known to
            fail and fall off, and outgases chemicals when heated – class 2B carcinogen type of chemicals. The choice is there for you though.
            </p>
            <p>
            Sound deadening liquids work the same way as the mats, but they can be painted or sprayed on instead of rolled
            on with a hand roller. We have our own proprietary formula here too. Spectrum is a water based, viscoelastic polymer
            formulated for peak vibration damping and adhesion. It’s rustproof, waterproof, chemical resistant, flame resistant,
            non-toxic, and dries odorless with a seamless, black finish. Just like with the mats, there are low quality options
            out there. Anything in an aerosol won’t have a nozzle big enough to spray particles big enough for effective sound 
            deadening. They are very convenient to use, but we choose not to offer <a href="/sound-deadening/soundproofing-liquid-sprays-and-paints/">sound deadening spray</a>
            in a can because it just doesn’t work all that well.
            </p>

                So there you have it. Mats or liquids. Pick what’s right for you. Even if you decide not to go with Second Skin,
                we’re happy to help you figure out your project.

                        trunk. I've installed other sound deadeners on other vehicles before and the

                        from my buddy's after we applied the Second Skin, it was raining. I didn't even

                        (the other guy's product) for my rear cab and am shocked at the
                        difference/effectiveness between the two. Yours was far superior. Keep up the

                        With the added high performance exhaust systems, it was impossible to achieve
                        acceptable sound quality from the stereo systems. We ordered Damplifier Pro,
                        received it in 2 days, applied it in a half hour and the results are amazing. We
                        have since then added a layer of Luxury Liner Pro. These are high performance
                        off-road vehicles with the comfort and sound insulation superior to the average
                        vehicle on the highway. For the price and quality, we have not found a

                        drive with practically no OEM dampening, race exhaust and a high-revving 1300
                        four-banger. My ears would ring after just five minutes. After just two packs of
                        Damplifier Pro we can have a quiet conversation inside - it's completely
                        different car. Now the whole family can enjoy it and I can even drive the kids
                        to school. The change is just unbelievable. Thanks to Second Skin I'll be able
                        to justify a Focal/Fosgate/Rainbow stereo in a car that used to sound like the
                        inside of a cement mixer.</blockquote>

                        best product I've used! I found the thicker foil to be actually easier to work
                        with. I know this doesn't sound right but it just seems to mold better into
                        creases and is rock solid once installed. I have used some other productsthat
                        wouldn't quite stay put once position but the thicker foil seems to have solved
                        that. All I can say is my car was once considered a "touring" car, but now has
                        become a LUXURY touring car! Thanks for making great product Second Skin!</blockquote>

                        thick and vs an 80 mil thick butyl. I applied samples to 2.5" x 6" heavy gauge
                        steel clips I got from a lumber yard and hung them from wire in my garage. After
                        striking each one with a hammer to hear for myself which one was more effective
                        I was blow away by how much more effective Damplifier was. I thought the 40 mil
                        thickness was going to be its weakness and I was wrong. It was by far the most
                        effective one at reducing the vibrations and ping after my hammer struck. I was
                        a skeptic but now I'm a believer.</blockquote>

                        some Damplifier Pro and some Luxury Liner Pro because they felt like it was a
                        new car. In my own car, I go about 85mph every day to work so road noise was a
                        huge issue even in my already quiet car by normal standards. Now I enjoy almost
                        airplane like silence as I glide down the road listening to my choice of radio
                        at a moderate volume while I wake up and prepare for the day to come.</blockquote>
